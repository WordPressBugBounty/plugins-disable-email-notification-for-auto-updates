This plugin will disable email notifications that WordPress sends, after an auto-update of plugins, themes, or WordPress.

== Description ==

As WordPress 5.5 introduced the feature of Enable auto-updates, it as well started sending emails for every update that was made. These email notifications may not actually be useful, rather just pile up in our inbox and if you have dozens of plugins or manage multiple websites, all these emails create an unnecessary mess.  Thus, this FREE PLUGIN, will stop or disable sending auto-updates email notifications that you receive after plugins, themes, or WordPress core are updated. However, please note that this plugin WILL NOT affect the AUTO-UPDATE feature of WordPress if it is enabled.

Anyway, simply install this plugin and you will stop getting all the annoying notifications for each and every auto-update that has been made to the plugins, themes, or even WordPress core. You will also have an option to disable some or all notifications as required.
